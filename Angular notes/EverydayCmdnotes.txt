1. To create a new component, use the command:
    > ng generate component <component-name>

Note: I have imported the home component inside the app component, which implies that a child component can be imported into a parent component. Can a parent component be imported into a child component? Additionally, the housing location component can be imported into the home component, indicating that a child component can be imported into another child component.
