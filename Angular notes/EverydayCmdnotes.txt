1. Creating a New Component:
    To create a new component, use the command:
    ```sh
    ng generate component <component-name>
    ```

    Note: 
    - I have imported the home component inside the app component, which implies that a child component can be imported into a parent component.
    - Can a parent component be imported into a child component?
    - The housing location component can be imported into the home component, indicating that a child component can be imported into another child component.

2. Creating a New Interface:
    To create a new interface, use the command:
    ```sh
    ng generate interface <interface-name>
    ```

    Questions on this unit:
    1. We created a `housingLocation` interface which has a set of data in it that we used in the home component. We created an instance of the interface and added values to it. Then, we imported the housing-location component inside the home component.
    - Question: How is the `housingLocation` interface related to the housing-location component?

3. Add inputs to the component
    - inputs allow compoenents to share data 
    - The direction of the data sharing is from parent component to child component

    Question: With standalone = true, will there be a concept of parent child ?
    syntax:
    @Input() : it is a decorator
